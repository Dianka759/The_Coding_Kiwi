# The_Coding_Kiwi

My very first project, done in Python with Flask, and MySQL database. 
Adapted functionalities from the original Coding Dojo learn platform with additional social aspect. 

- Login and Registration feature with validations utilizing Bcrypt’s password hashing and encryption to
secure sensitive user information.
- Integrated Dad Joke’s API for better user experience and humor enhancement.
- Designed UI with CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for engaging user experience
