As a user I want to be able to access my educational materials in one spot, without having to use a bunch of different websites and applications. I want to be able to find the recorded lectures and resource links  provided on one page. I also want to  have a personal profile where I am able to write my own notes and be able to view my classmates notes if I need clarity on stuff. Lastly, I would like to get to know the people in my cohort without necessarily having to connect on social media in case they don't feel comfortable with that, so having a profile with a lil personal summary and hobbies would be fun.
